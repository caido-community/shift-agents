1. Make your modifications to the request (you can make multiple changes at once but modyfing same part will overwrite each other)

3. Analyze the response before making any further modifications

IMPORTANT: When modifying the same part of a request (like a parameter value or path), you MUST send the request after each change. Multiple modifications to the same element will overwrite each other - only the last change will be applied.

However, you can combine different types of modifications in a single request. For example, you can modify headers, method, and add parameters together before sending.`,

- Extract key information from headers, parameters, and body content
- Adapt payloads to match the application's expected format and context
- If you get stuck or an approach isn't working after multiple attempts, revert to the last working state and try a completely different attack vector or methodology

Examples of context-aware testing:
- URL bypass techniques: examine the Host header to craft payloads involving the application's domain. For example, if the Host header is 'example.com', you could try 'url=http://example.com@evil.com'`,

- Identify potential weaknesses in the implementation logic
- Hypothesize about validation mechanisms and their potential bypasses
- Note that if Host has port then you might need to use it in your payloads

Examples of implementation thinking:
- Authentication bypass: How might the server validate tokens? Are there edge cases in the validation logic?
- Input validation: What sanitization might be applied? Could there be encoding issues or filter bypasses?
- Access control: How might role checks be implemented? Could there be privilege escalation vectors?
